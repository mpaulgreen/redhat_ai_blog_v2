         - Enable emergency CloudShield strict mode to block all non-essential outbound traffic
         - Identify source devices using NetworkIQ traffic analysis
         - Check SecureNode logs for lateral movement between network segments
         - Alert customer immediately about potential security breach
      
      2. **Threat Assessment** (10 minutes):
         - Analyze cryptocurrency wallet addresses and mining pool destinations
         - Check for known cryptojacking malware signatures in traffic patterns
         - Review recent device installations or software updates
         - Verify if mining traffic correlates with specific user activities
      
      3. **Advanced Investigation** (15 minutes):

         - Set up NetworkIQ alerts for unusual CPU-intensive network activity
         - Recommend customer endpoint security assessment
         - Schedule weekly monitoring for 30 days post-incident
      
      Document all findings and coordinate with law enforcement if criminal activity suspected.

  - question: |
      An Enterprise customer reports that their VoicePrint biometric authentication on VoiceLink Pro
      is failing intermittently. They suspect potential voice spoofing attacks targeting their executives.
      What security investigation should I conduct?
    answer: |
      For suspected VoicePrint spoofing attacks on VoiceLink Pro:
      
      1. **VoicePrint Security Analysis** (5 minutes):
         - Access VoiceLink Pro biometric logs for failed authentication attempts
         - Check for patterns in failed authentications (timing, source, targets)
         - Verify VoicePrint algorithm version and security parameters
         - Review any recent executive voice recordings or public appearances
      
      2. **Audio Forensics Investigation** (15 minutes):
         - Analyze audio samples from failed authentication attempts
         - Check for signs of synthetic voice generation or deepfake audio
         - Compare spectral analysis of suspicious calls with baseline voiceprints
         - Look for compression artifacts or digital manipulation signatures
      
      3. **Source Tracking and Intelligence** (10 minutes):
         - Trace call origins and routing through NetworkIQ analytics
         - Check if attacks correlate with public executive appearances or recordings
         - Analyze timing patterns for social engineering campaign indicators
         - Cross-reference with known voice spoofing attack vectors
      
      4. **Enhanced Security Response**:
         - **If spoofing confirmed**: Immediately update VoicePrint sensitivity parameters
         - **If targeted campaign**: Enable multi-factor authentication for executive accounts
         - **If ongoing threat**: Implement real-time voice anomaly detection
         - **If sophisticated attack**: Engage federal cybersecurity authorities
      
      5. **Executive Protection Measures**:
         - Brief executives on voice spoofing risks and verification procedures
         - Implement callback verification for sensitive VoiceLink Pro transactions
         - Enhanced logging for all executive VoicePrint interactions
         - Regular VoicePrint baseline updates to detect gradual spoofing attempts
      
      Coordinate with corporate security and legal teams for potential criminal investigation.

## Training Process

### Verify Taxonomies

Before training, verify all taxonomies are properly formatted:

```bash
# Verify all taxonomy changes
ilab taxonomy diff
```

You should see output showing three new files:
- `knowledge/telecomcorp/qna.yaml`
- `compositional_skills/telecomcorp_troubleshooting/qna.yaml`
- `compositional_skills/telecomcorp_security/qna.yaml`

### Download Base Model

```bash
# Download a base model to work with (if not already done during initialization)
ilab model download
```

### Generate Training Data

```bash
# Generate synthetic training data (increased number for multiple taxonomies)
ilab data generate --num-instructions 1000
```

This process will create synthetic training examples based on your taxonomies. The more instructions you generate, the better the model training, but it will take longer.

### Train the Model

```bash
# Train the model with both knowledge and skills
ilab model train
```

Training time depends on your hardware:
- **CPU only**: 2-6 hours
- **GPU available**: 30-90 minutes
- **Apple Silicon**: 1-3 hours

### Convert Model (Apple Silicon Only)

If you're on Apple Silicon, convert the model for compatibility:

```bash
# Convert model for macOS compatibility
ilab model convert --model-dir ~/.local/share/instructlab/checkpoints/instructlab-granite-7b-lab-mlx-q
```

## Model Performance Evaluation and Testing Results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Taxonomy Validation Errors

**Problem**: `ilab taxonomy diff` shows validation errors

**Solutions**:
- Ensure no trailing spaces at the end of lines
- Verify proper YAML indentation (2 spaces)
- Check all required fields are present
- Ensure at least 5 seed examples per taxonomy

#### Training Performance Issues

**Problem**: Training is very slow or fails

**Solutions**:
- Start with fewer instructions: `--num-instructions 100` for testing
- Check available RAM (minimum 16GB recommended)
- Ensure sufficient disk space (100GB+)
- Monitor system resources during training
