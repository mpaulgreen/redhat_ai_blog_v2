      An Enterprise customer wants to integrate their existing MPLS network with TelecomCorp's
      FiberLink Pro service for hybrid connectivity. What planning steps should I recommend?
    answer: |
      For Enterprise MPLS-FiberLink Pro hybrid integration, provide this planning guidance:
      1. **Current Network Assessment** (Planning Phase):
         - Document existing MPLS topology, bandwidth, and SLA requirements
         - Identify critical applications and their performance needs
         - Review current routing protocols (BGP, OSPF) and IP addressing
         - Assess security policies and compliance requirements
      2. **FiberLink Pro Integration Design**:
         - Plan quantum-encrypted tunnels over FiberLink Pro
         - Design BGP routing for intelligent path selection
         - Configure MPLS-over-FiberLink Pro for seamless integration
         - Plan bandwidth allocation between MPLS and FiberLink Pro paths
      3. **Hybrid Connectivity Architecture**:
         - Primary traffic via FiberLink Pro (25 Gbps capacity)
         - MPLS as backup/overflow path with automatic failover
         - Critical applications get dedicated FiberLink Pro bandwidth
         - Non-critical traffic load-balanced across both connections
      4. **Implementation Strategy**:
         - Phase 1: Install FiberLink Pro alongside existing MPLS
         - Phase 2: Configure hybrid routing with gradual traffic migration
         - Phase 3: Optimize performance and security policies
         - Phase 4: Full production with MPLS as backup only
      5. **TelecomCorp Integration Services**:
         - Assign dedicated Enterprise Solutions Architect
         - Provide FiberLink Pro-MPLS integration guide
         - Schedule quantum encryption key management setup
         - Include NetworkIQ analytics for both connection types
         - Offer 24/7 white-glove support during migration
      Recommend 90-day integration timeline with monthly milestone reviews.
