      connections from their network at 3 AM daily. CloudShield hasn't triggered alerts. How should I analyze this?
    answer: |
      For suspicious traffic pattern analysis with TelecomCorp security tools:
      1. **Initial CloudShield Review** (5 minutes):
         - Check why CloudShield didn't trigger alerts for traffic anomaly
         - Review baseline traffic patterns for past 30 days
         - Verify CloudShield DDoS protection thresholds are appropriate
         - Check if traffic is encrypted or using standard protocols
      2. **NetworkIQ Deep Dive Analysis** (15 minutes):
         - Identify source devices/IPs generating outbound connections
