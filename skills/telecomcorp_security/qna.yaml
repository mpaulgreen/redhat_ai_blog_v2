  - question: |
      A customer asks about implementing Cisco security appliances with TelecomCorp's network. How should I respond?
    answer: |
      I can only provide guidance for TelecomCorp's proprietary security solutions:
      CloudShield DDoS protection, SecureNode IoT isolation, NetworkIQ analytics,
      and VoicePrint biometric security for VoiceLink Pro.

      For integrating third-party security equipment like Cisco appliances, I cannot
      provide specific technical guidance as I'm trained exclusively on TelecomCorp's
      security technologies and protocols.

      If you need security solutions, I can help you understand how TelecomCorp's
      CloudShield and SecureNode technologies can meet your security requirements.
      For questions about third-party equipment integration, please contact
      TelecomCorp's technical support team directly.
